//! Oyvey — the Rak package manager and build system.
//!
//! Repository: <https://github.com/Louiml/oyvey>
//!
//! Oyvey is the official package manager for the Rak language. It is
//! Cargo-inspired: a `package.rak` manifest declares the project and its
//! dependencies, an `oyvey.lock` lockfile records the exact resolved revision
//! and checksum of every dependency, and a global git cache keeps clones so
//! builds are reproducible and work offline once resolved.
//!
//! ```text
//! oyvey new <project>     generate a new Rak project
//! oyvey init              initialize an existing directory
//! oyvey add <github-repo> add a GitHub package dependency
//! oyvey remove <package>  drop a dependency
//! oyvey install           resolve + vendor dependencies (writes oyvey.lock)
//! oyvey update            re-resolve within constraints
//! oyvey build             compile the entry point through rakc
//! oyvey run               run the entry point
//! oyvey test              run the project's tests
//! oyvey clean             remove build artifacts
//! oyvey list              list installed packages
//! ```
//!
//! The crate is split into small modules so the compiler, IDE, and fuzz
//! targets can reuse the manifest/lockfile logic without shelling out to the
//! `oyvey` binary:
//!
//! * [`manifest`] — parse the `package.rak` manifest (a Rak file with `let`
//!   bindings, matching Rak's existing package conventions).
//! * [`spec`] — parse `user/repo[@constraint][#rev]` dependency specs and
//!   semver constraint satisfaction.
//! * [`lock`] — read/write the `oyvey.lock` TOML lockfile.
//! * [`git`] — git operations against the global cache (clone/fetch/checkout).
//! * [`cache`] — the on-disk layout of the global cache.
//! * [`resolve`] — transitive dependency resolution.
//! * [`project`] — project discovery and `oyvey new` scaffolding.

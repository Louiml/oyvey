# Oyvey

The package manager and build system for the [Rak](https://github.com/Louiml/Rak)
programming language.

Oyvey is Cargo-shaped and Rak-native: a `package.rak` manifest declares a
project and its dependencies, an `oyvey.lock` records the exact git revision
and checksum of every dependency, and a global cache keeps clones so builds are
reproducible and work offline once resolved. It drives the existing `rakc`
compiler for `build`, `run`, and `test` — it does not duplicate any of it.

```bash
oyvey new myproj        # generate a project (manifest, src/main.rak, tests)
oyvey add user/repo     # add a GitHub dependency
oyvey install           # resolve + install dependencies (writes oyvey.lock)
oyvey run               # run the entry point
oyvey test              # run the project's tests
oyvey build             # build a standalone executable
```

## Install

Oyvey ships with the Rak toolchain. The Rak installer puts it on your `PATH`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Louiml/Rak/main/dist/install.sh | bash -s -- --yes --install rakc,oyvey
```

Or build it from this repository:

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/oyvey --version
```

Requirements: a Rust toolchain to build, and `git` on `PATH` at runtime (every
dependency is a git repository).

## The manifest

`package.rak` is a Rak file with `let` bindings:

```rak
let name = "mylib"
let version = "0.1.0"
let description = "A Rak package"
let license = "MIT"
let entry = "src/main.rak"
let deps = {
    net: "user/rak-net",
    crypto: "user/rak-crypto@^1.0"
}
```

`entry` is optional. When it is absent, Oyvey infers it from `init.rak`,
`lib.rak`, `main.rak`, `src/lib.rak`, then `src/main.rak`.

## Dependency specs

| Spec | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `user/repo` | track the default branch |
| `user/repo@^1.2` | caret — compatible with `1.2` |
| `user/repo@~1.2` | tilde — compatible with `1.2.x` |
| `user/repo@1.2.3` | exact version |
| `user/repo@*` | any release (pre-releases need naming) |
| `user/repo#<rev>` | pin to a git revision (tag, branch, or commit) |
| `https://host/user/repo` | an explicit URL, for a self-hosted Git server |

A `#rev` may be combined with a constraint (`user/repo@^1.2#deadbeef`); the
revision wins. Dependencies of dependencies are resolved automatically. A
dependency cycle is fine; two different sources claiming the same package name
is reported as a conflict rather than resolved silently one way.

## The lockfile

`oyvey.lock` is TOML. Each package records the revision it was built from and a
SHA-256 over its whole vendored directory:

```toml
version = 1

[[package]]
name = "rak-net"
version = "0.2.1"
source = "git+https://github.com/user/rak-net#0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"
checksum = "6f1e2b..."
```

The checksum covers every file in the package, each contributing its path and its
bytes, so an edit to any source file *and* a rename are both detected. It used to
cover `package.rak` alone, which left the package's actual code -- including the
entry point that runs -- unverified: an edited dependency still audited as intact.

`oyvey install` reuses the locked revision whenever it still satisfies the
manifest, which is what makes an install reproducible. `oyvey update`
re-resolves to the newest matching versions. `oyvey audit` checks the installed
packages against these checksums, and reports a file it could not read separately
from a mismatch, since those are different problems.

## How imports find a dependency

Installed packages are vendored into `<project>/packages/`, which is the
directory `rakc` already searches for a bare `import <name>`. When `run`,
`build`, and `test` invoke the compiler, they prepend that directory to
`RAK_PATH`, so imports resolve wherever the entry point lives:

```rak
import mylib
dump mylib.greet()
```

A package whose entry is a single file gets a generated `init.rak` that
re-exports it, which is what turns it into a directory package the compiler can
resolve by name.

## Cache

```text
~/.oyvey/git/db/<source>/             bare clones, one per source URL
~/.oyvey/git/checkouts/<source>/<rev>/ one working tree per locked revision
```

Set `OYVEY_HOME` to move it.

An existing checkout is always reused without invoking git, so a repeated install
is offline by default. `--offline` makes that a rule rather than an optimisation:
anything not already on disk is an error instead of a fetch.

```text
oyvey install --offline   never touch the network
oyvey install --locked    require an up-to-date lockfile; refuse to change it
oyvey install --frozen    both of the above
```

`--locked` is checked before anything is written, and names the package or the
mismatch that would have changed the lockfile. `install`, `update` and `lock`
accept all three; `build`, `run` and `test` accept `--offline`.

An unrecognised flag is an error rather than being ignored. Silently dropping an
option makes the command look like it honoured it, which is worse than failing.
